# ‚öôÔ∏è Development

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs), v16.13.1 (recommended) or higher
2. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), v8.x (recommended) or higher

## Install

Download the current codebase or create a fork. Navigate to the root of the project directory in your terminal window and call `npm install`. This will install the required node module dependencies into your project folder.

## Run

Next, call `node run dev`. This will start the Next.js server in development mode.

Finally, open a browser window and navigate to `localhost:3000`. This is the Next.JS project running in your browser.
